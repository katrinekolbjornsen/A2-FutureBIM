### Changes made in the files
Removed +$(this).attr('level') which gives the level-number as an output. 

Added more floors, changing the data as floor-names, elevation etc.

Added an input that gives the volume of concrete located at each floor, consisting of all the structural parts (beam, columns, slabs). 

Added a summarization of all the concrete in the building.

Added a text that shows in the beginning, explaining that you have to choose a floor to extract the information availble about each floor. 




To optimize the solution, we would get the dimensions of all the structural parts made from concrete, and summized these to get the exact volume of concrete per floor and in building as a total.
